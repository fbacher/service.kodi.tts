Text to speech for Kodi (XBMC)
------------------------------
Adds speech to Kodi. It does this by using the available speech engines for the particular platform, and aims to
work 'out of the box' as much as possible.

Installation should be done through Kodi System::Settings::Add-ons::Get Add-Ons::All Add-Ons::Services::XBMC TTS

If you want to ensure you are using the latest version of the addon you can install my [repository .zip file](http://ruuks-repo.googlecode.com/files/ruuk.addon.repository-1.0.0.zip).

Installation of the repository should be done through Kodi System::Settings::Add-ons::Install from zip file
