        Provides a wrapper around waitForAbort to avoid several problems:
           1) There are issues with calling xbmc.monitor.waitForAbort on
              multiple threads. Best luck seems to be always running it on
              main thread.
           2) _abort_received Event is set once waitForAbort indicates abort
              has occured. Other threads, via Monitor.py utilize this.

        During startup, we try to reduce dependencies. So here we use xbmc.log
        instead of BasicLogger.
